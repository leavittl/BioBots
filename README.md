Start at the login.html page! Everything else should be navigable from there. (You can either login as 'admin' or by typing in any
of the emails in the large JSON file. To log in, you can type anything for the password.) I think that everything should be pretty
self-explanatory, but if you have any questions about my web app, please let me know!
